# reimplment-djb2-hashing
just a simple little hash table for strings in python to prove to a friend that I can do this 

Reimplements djb2 hashing in python for strings. It's supposidly pretty good 

A long time ago, I had a C++ assignment to do something similar to this that I got messed up on because I did not know about the existence of https://cdecl.org/, so I am doing it again in python3

Run the .py file

Change the "len_of_table" variable to initialize the hash_table with a different number of buckets
